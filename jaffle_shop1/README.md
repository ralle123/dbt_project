Welcome to your new dbt project!

### Using the jaffle shop1 

Try running the following commands:

- dbt debug

    Ensure your profile is setup correctly from the command line

- dbt seed

    Load the CSVs with the demo data set. This materializes the CSVs as tables in your target schema. Note that a typical dbt project does not require this step since dbt assumes your raw data is already in your warehouse.

- dbt test

    Test the output of the models

- dbt docs generate

    Generate documentation for the project

- dbt docs serve

    View the documentation for the project
